<h2>SPRING</h2>
<p>
Spring Framework is a Java platform that provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing Java applications. Spring handles the infrastructure so you can focus on your application.
</p>
<p>
Spring enables you to build applications from “plain old Java objects” (POJOs) and to apply enterprise services non-invasively to POJOs. This capability applies to the Java SE programming model and to full and partial Java EE.
</p>
<p>
Examples of how you, as an application developer, can use the Spring platform advantage:

Make a Java method execute in a database transaction without having to deal with transaction APIs.

Make a local Java method a remote procedure without having to deal with remote APIs.

Make a local Java method a management operation without having to deal with JMX APIs.

Make a local Java method a message handler without having to deal with JMS APIs.
